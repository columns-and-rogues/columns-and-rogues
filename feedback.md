Very impressive accomplishment! I've refactored some code in places to reduce duplication, and it's obvious that this is a work-in-progress, but for a four-day full stack project, I think y'all were able to realize a lot of the goals I heard expressed at the beginning of the project, and you made decision (like the Character component) that will make it easy to pick up and add features to in the future. Some of the variable names are a bit obtuse, and some of the code is pretty difficult to understand (the createBoard function comes to mind), but that's kind of the nature of game development.
